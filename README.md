## Overview
This project analyzes unemployment trends in India using statistical methods and data visualization techniques. It includes:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
- Analyzing trends in unemployment rates over time.
- Comparing regional unemployment rates.
- Studying the relationship between labor participation and unemployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For handling and cleaning data.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For creating insightful visualizations.

## Features
- Time-series analysis of unemployment rates.
- Regional unemployment rate comparisons.
- Scatter plot to explore labor participation and unemployment.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/unemployment-analysis.git
   cd unemployment-analysis
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
